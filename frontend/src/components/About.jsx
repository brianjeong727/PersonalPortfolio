      <p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed text-lg">
        I'm a software engineer studying Computer Science and Data Science at the University of Pittsburgh. 
        I love building tools, products, and experiences that feel thoughtful — where design, clarity, and 
        technical precision work together to make something impactful.
      </p>

      <p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed text-lg mt-6">
        Recently, I’ve worked on projects ranging from AI-driven academic insight tools to esports analytics 
        dashboards and CMS-driven marketing sites. I care about building software that solves real problems, 
        and I enjoy working across the stack — from data and APIs to intuitive interfaces.
